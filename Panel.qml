// A notification center for Omarchy: everything you were sent, still there
// when you go back for it.
//
// Omarchy already writes every notification to disk: one JSON file per popup
// under ~/.local/state/omarchy/notifications/, moved into history/ when it
// leaves the screen. That is where these come from, and nothing here writes to
// those directories. What it is not is a history you can read: it holds ten
// files, deletes the eleventh, and deletes the icon it was keeping for it at
// the same time. Ten is the right number for a service whose job is replaying
// the toasts you just missed, and far too few for the question this panel
// exists to answer, which is "what did that say".
//
// So `bin/notification-center` copies each file out of there the moment it
// lands, into an archive kept for as long as you asked for, icon and all. It
// follows the directory with inotify rather than polling it, so a notification
// is in the archive before its toast has finished appearing.
//
// Glyphs are \u escapes rather than literal characters, so the source survives
// editors and patches that mangle private-use codepoints.
